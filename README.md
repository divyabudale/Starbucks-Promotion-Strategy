# Installation <a name="Installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation <a name='Motivation'></a>

The motivation of the project was to evaluate a Starbucks' promotion strategy based on some predetermined metrics using statistical analysis. 

# File Descriptions <a name="Descriptions"></a>

#### test and training data
The training data was used to evaluate the success of their blind experiment and to train a model that would predict which individuals would use the promotion to make a purchase. The testing data was used to evaluate the model.
#### Starbucks_Promotion_Strategy.ipynb
This notebook contains the full process and outline for the project.
#### test_results.py
This python file contains two basic functions that are used in the notebook to test specific metrics of our model.

# Results <a name='Results'></a>

In this analysis, the main takeaways:
1. Hypothesis testing was performed to understand the effect of promotion on both evaluation and invariant metrics.
2. XGBoost classifier was used to predict if a customer will be responsive to the campaign.
